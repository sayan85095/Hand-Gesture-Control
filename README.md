# Hand-Gesture-Control
Hand Gesture Control using Python is a computer vision–based system that allows users to control computer functions through hand movements. It uses a webcam with OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect hand landmarks in real time and map gestures to actions like mouse movement, clicking, and volume control.
